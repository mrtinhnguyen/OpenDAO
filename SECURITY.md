## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   pnpm update
   ```

2. **Use environment variables for secrets**
   - Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
   - Use `.env` files for local development
   - Use secure secret management in production

3. **Enable security features**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Enable CORS properly
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use secure authentication

4. **Regular security audits**
   ```bash
   pnpm audit
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Input validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use role-based access control
   - Validate permissions on every request

3. **Database security**
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security updates

4. **API security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use proper HTTP status codes
   - Validate request headers
